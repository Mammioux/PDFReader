PDFReader
=========

PDFReader using UIPageViewController 
Based on Reader project that you can find here: https://github.com/vfr/Reader
 
I'm changing the Reader to use UIPageViewController instead of UIScrollView and 
to use UIToolBar instead of a regular UIView to show the MainPageToolbar.

It is based on the fork of vfr/Reader project but it creates an static library and only works with iOS6+
